  <em>A terminal text editor that refuses to pick a side.</em>
</p>

## What is Void?

Void is a terminal-native text editor built from scratch in Python with the curses library. Although inspired by Vim/Neovim, it does not aim to clone them. It shares a baseline with other terminal editors, that is necessary for a good user experience. After a baseline of a standard feature implementation, It WILL grow into it's own unique identity.

I have Vim motions as the current foundation of movement because I believe that language of movement is simply the fastest way to navigate and manipulate text. There are many features in both IDE's and terminal editors I plan to inherit because some things shouldn't change.

Tabbed editing. An embedded terminal. A file finder panel. Visual selection. Syntax highlighting. Find and replace with confirmation workflows. Auto-pairing. Auto-indentation. Undo history. A floating HUD. All of it running inside your terminal, all of it driven by the keyboard, and all of it just the beginning.

## Current State

**Void is a work in progress.** It has rough edges, I am VERY new to shipping any type of software let alone a tool of this scope. There are still plenty of missing features and things will or may break and my ideas aren't all concrete, but that's what it's all about. I want this to be something that it's users find truly useful, but I can't get there without going through the tribulations. This is an actively evolving project, not a polished release BY ANY MEANS. Things will be subject to change, improvement and outright being thrown out.

That being said -- it works. You can open files, edit them, save them, search through them, select and manipulate text visually, manage tabs, run shell commands, and navigate your filesystem without ever leaving the terminal or reaching for a mouse.

## Features

- **Vim motions** — `h` `j` `k` `l`, `w` `b`, `gg` `G`, `d` + motion, `yy`, `p`, and more
- **Modal editing** — Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command modes
- **Visual mode** — Character (`v`), Line (`V`), and Block (`Ctrl+V`) selection with delete, yank, change, and indent operations
- **Tabbed buffers** — Open multiple files, switch between them with `gt`/`gT` or `:tabn`/`:tabp`
- **Integrated terminal** — Toggle an inline shell panel with `Ctrl+T`, run commands without leaving the editor
- **File finder** — Browse and open files from a side panel with `Ctrl+F`
- **Search and replace** — `/query` to search, `/find/replace/g` for bulk replace, `/find/replace/gc` for confirmation-based replace
- **Syntax highlighting** — Token-based highlighting for Python, C++, C, Rust and JavaScript (more languages to come)
- **Auto-indentation** — Smart indent that respects Python block structures
- **Auto-pairing** — Brackets, braces, parentheses, and quotes auto-close in Insert mode
- **Undo/Redo** — Full undo history with `u` and `Ctrl+R`
- **Bracket matching** — Highlights the matching bracket or quote under the cursor
- **Indent guides** — Vertical guides drawn through indentation levels, with active block highlighting
- **Cursor line highlighting** — Visual emphasis on the current line
- **Floating HUD** — Mode indicator, filetype, clock, and session timer in a top-right overlay
- **Horizontal scrolling** — Smooth margin-based scrolling for long lines
- **Splash screen** — Animated matrix rain startup with recent file access and keybind hints
- **Recent files** — Tracks and surfaces your recently opened files on launch

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (uv installs this automatically)
- A terminal emulator with color support


### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryybash/Void.git
cd Void
```


Then install with any of:
```bash
uv tool install .     # recommended
pipx install .        # alternative
pip install .         # if you don't have uv or pipx
```



### Usage
```bash
void               # Open with splash screen 
void myfile.py     # Open specific file type/extension 
```



## Keybinds

A full keybind reference is available in [`keybinds.md`](keybinds.md).

**Quick overview:**

```
NORMAL                          INSERT
h j k l .... move cursor        Esc ........ back to Normal
w b ........ word jump          Enter ...... new line (auto-indent)
0 $ ^ ...... line start/end     Backspace .. delete behind
gg / G ..... file top/bottom    ([{"' ...... auto-pair
Ctrl+D/U ... half-page scroll

i .......... enter Insert       VISUAL (v / V / Ctrl+V)
o / O ...... open line below/   h j k l .... extend selection
             above              d / x ...... delete selection
dd ......... delete line        y .......... yank selection
dw d$ d0 ... delete motion      c .......... change selection
yy ......... yank line          > / < ...... indent / dedent
p / P ...... paste after/before
u .......... undo               TERMINAL (Ctrl+T)
Ctrl+R ..... redo               Esc ........ back to editor
v .......... visual (char)      Enter ...... run command
V .......... visual (line)      Up/Down .... command history
Ctrl+V ..... visual (block)
/ .......... search             FILE FINDER (Ctrl+F)
n / N ...... next/prev match    j/k ........ navigate
gt / gT .... next/prev tab      Enter ...... open / navigate
                                h .......... go back a directory
                                r .......... refresh file finder
                               `.` ........ show hidden files (dots)
COMMAND MODE (:)
:w  :q  :wq  :q!  :e <file>  
:tabnew <file>  :saveas <file> 
:config (open/generate config.json)

## The Road Ahead

I believe there is a space "in-between" among text editors and IDE's, a space where my eyes are set. On one end, you have Vim/Neovim — fast, endlessly configurable, but quite minimal by design. On the other, you have full blown Dev environments(IDE's) that are rich with features, visually intuitive, but with heavy and inefficient mouse-driven workflows. I imagine Void filling a gap most would say does not exist, a gap in-between that takes the best from both worlds while not paying the consequences. I want to see how far you can really go with something like this. I want to push the boundaries of this space, why? Because I love a good, elegant tool, but most importantly...why not?


A few long term goals include rewriting performance critical parts in a systems language as the project grows. It will have broader language support, plugin architecture, user configuration files. It will also have features that have traditionally been reserved for heavyweight editors, but most excitingly, features you would not expect in a terminal based tool.

This is just the beginning of a project I am already deeply fond of :p
